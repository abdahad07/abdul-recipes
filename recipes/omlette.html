    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> An omelette (also spelled omelet) is a dish made from eggs, 
        fried with butter or oil in a frying pan.</p>
    <p> It is a common practice for the omelette to be folded 
        around fillings such as chives, vegetables, mushrooms, meat
        (often ham or bacon), cheese, onions or some combination of
        the above. Whole eggs or egg whites are often beaten with 
        a small amount of milk, cream, or water.</p>
